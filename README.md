The conclusions are irrefutable: Organized religion and spirituality have very positive effects on the subjective well-being of their adherents. Moments of imagination and rumination on greater purpose sparked by serendipity, strict value systems that approximate the ideal and constrain the community, accountability, commitment, socialization. No time is better spent than thinking about and enacting the greater good.

## The Case for this Religion

Monotheistic origin stories are provably false. The moral baggage that comes with dated holy books is insurmountable. The more modern religions on offer make unsupportable truth claims without transparency or discoverability, and in every case are a product of a soulless and selfishly motivated individual. There is a clear space for a self-aware, revisionist, tech-enabled religion.

## The Constraints on this Religion

Moral code, worldview, and ritual – I expect the scope to increase as the trajectory trends up.

## Contribution

Please open issues and PRs to discuss revisions. We'll put more rules in place as we iterate. I expect a weekly version bump ([semver](http://semver.org/))

## Thank You
